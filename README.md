# web3-boilerplate

## Motivation 

- Most existing boilerplates bring too many dependencies, or are not maintained anymore
- Let anyone choose their dependencies by documenting all the steps done to build the boilerplate 

## Stacks

- ReactJS 
- TypeScript 
- Tailwind
- React Router

## Steps 

- Init the react app with typescript: `npx create-react-app@latest my-app --template typescript`
